# project 7 employee directory with public api

In this project I built an employee directory using a public API "Random User Generator". I requested random user data from the API using AJAX and displayed the information on the page dynamically. I also implemented a search filter which can let users search by employee names.

Technologies used:

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

AJAX

Public API: "Random User Generator" url: https://randomuser.me/documentation#misc
